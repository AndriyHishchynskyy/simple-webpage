    <p><strong>1)</strong> Koalas are found in the eucalyptus forests of eastern 
    <strong>Australia</strong>. They have grey fur with a cream-coloured chest, 
    and strong, clawed feet, perfect for living in the branches of trees!
    </p>
    <p><strong>2)</strong> Cuddly critters, koalas measure about 
    <strong>60cm</strong> to<strong> 85cm</strong> long, and weigh about <strong>14kg</strong>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3)</strong> Although you may have heard people call them koala ‘bears’, 
    these awesome animals aren’t bears at all – they are in fact&nbsp;<em>marsupials</em>. 
    A group of mammals, most marsupials have pouches where their newborns develop.
    </p>
    <p><strong>4)</strong> A joey grows and develops in the pouch for about <strong>six months</strong>. 
    Once strong enough, the youngster rides around on its mother’s back for a further six months, only using the pouch to feed.
    </p>
    <p><strong>5) </strong>Koala’s grow up to become big eaters, shifting up to <strong>one kilogram of eucalyptus leaves</strong> in a day! 
    They are fussy, too, and will select the most nutritious and tastiest leaves from the trees where they live.
    </p>
    <p><strong>7)</strong>&nbsp;These magnificent mammals get their name form an Aboriginal<strong>*</strong> term meaning, ‘<strong>no drink’</strong>. 
    It’s believed this is because koalas get almost all their moisture from the leaves they eat, and rarely drink water.
    </p>
    <p><strong>8)</strong> Although these beautiful creatures are protected by law, and not classed as an endangered species, their habitat is under threat. 
    Sadly, around <strong>80% of koala habitat has been lost</strong> to human homes, drought and forest fires.</p>
